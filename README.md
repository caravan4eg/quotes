Once upon a time a beginner programmer decided to develop a web project that combines together several modern technologies. When he began to learn programming, he didnâ€™t know much about it and therefore wrote down everything he did. These notes will helped him to keep in mind what, when  to do and how to use:
- Django framework to build web server
- Scrapy framework to create own spider and extract the data you need from websites. 
- Django ORM to create SQL query and interact with SQLite database. 
- Django REST Framework to create Web API service
- Celery and Redis to launch background data update or other periodic tasks.
